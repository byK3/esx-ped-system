    Simple system to set a ped to a player with comamnd. 
    Peds are stored in a JSON & set on connect (if available).

    /setPed [ID] [ped-model]

    Example: /setped 37 a_f_m_fatcult_01

    Reset Example: /setped 37 reset

    At reset a ped (default: mp_m_freemode_01) is set.

    You can edit the command and standard ped model in the config.
